# Example Playbook for ansible-role-govready

## Requirements

- ansible v1.9.1 or higher
- vagrant v1.8.6 or higher (1.8.5 has [ssh key issues](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/7610))

This directory contains tests for the CivicActions.govready role in the form of a Vagrant environment.

## Test setup

Install the `govready` role into a newly created `roles/` directory and add two supporting roles: the openscap scanner and the scap-security-guide content:

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy install CivicActions.govready -p .
$ cd CivicActions.govready/tests
$ mkdir roles
$ ansible-galaxy install CivicActions.openscap CivicActions.scap-security-guide -p roles
$ ln -fs ../../../CivicActions.govready roles/CivicActions.govready
```

You may want to change the base box into one that you like. The current one is based on hashicorp's [CentOS 7 box](https://atlas.hashicorp.com/centos/boxes/7).

The playbook [`test.yml`](tests/test.yml) applies the role to a VM, setting role variables.

## Run the commands below on the indicated machine
Key:

- *Host* - the machine which is hosting your Vagrant virtual machines (VMs)
- *Dashboard* - the VM that will be running scans on a remote server (IP=192.168.56.101)
- *Server* - the VM that will be scanned and hardened (IP=192.168.56.102)

### Host: Provision two vagrant machines: dashboard and server:

First create an SSH key pair to be used by oscap-user, then create and provision the two vagrant test servers.

```bash
$ ./create_keys.sh
$ vagrant up
```

### Dashboard: Run the first scan of 'server'
_Note: The myfisma/GovReadyfile was set up during provisioning._

```bash
$ vagrant ssh dashboard
[vagrant@localhost ~]$ cd myfisma
[vagrant@localhost myfisma]$ govready scan
```

Since this is the first time that the Dashboard is connecting to the Server, you will be asked:

`Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? `_yes_

### Dashboard: Interpreting results

The `govready` script provides a ("quickie report") summary of the scan results. Most Authorizing Officials will want all High and Medium controls remediated or waivers and an Acceptance of Risk report may need to be filed.

- This profile identifies 33 high severity selected controls. OpenSCAP says 21 passing, 10 failing, and 2 notchecked.
- This profile identifies 124 medium severity selected controls. OpenSCAP says 49 passing, 73 failing, and 2 notchecked.
- This profile identifies 61 low severity selected controls. OpenSCAP says 16 passing, 38 failing, and 6 notchecked.

### Host: `./dashboard/scans/` directory

Look in the newly created `./dashboard/scans/` directory for the complete results of the OpenSCAP scan of the `server` instance (IP = 192.168.56.102).

### Dashboard: Scan your own sites

By setting the environment variables `GOVREADY_OSCAP_USER` (must have sudo capability) and `GOVREADY_OSCAP_HOST` you can scan any host that has openscap installed. E.g.,

```bash
	[vagrant@localhost myfisma]$ export GOVREADY_OSCAP_USER=rootable
	[vagrant@localhost myfisma]$ export GOVREADY_OSCAP_HOST=myhost.example.com
	[vagrant@localhost myfisma]$ govready scan
```

All the variables in UPPER case in the GovReadyFile can be overridden with environment variables prefixed with `GOVREADY_`

Note that the remote sites don't need govready nor the scap-security-guide, but they will need the OpenSCAP scanner. See the README for ansible-roles-openscap for information on how to install the latest copy.

### Remediation. This section is a work in progress

_Note: The process for remediation is in flux and `govready fix` no longer works. Currently we are using the [simple-harden](https://galaxy.ansible.com/CivicActions/simple-harden/) role which is still being tested._

OpenSCAP remediation:
```
oscap-ssh sudo oscap-user@192.168.56.102 22 xccdf eval --remediate --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_stig-rhel7-server-upstream --results scans/remediation-results.xml --fetch-remote-resources scap/ssg-centos7-ds.xml
```

For testing with your vagrant boxes created above, first install the `simple-harden` role:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install CivicActions.simple-harden -p roles
```

Then create two files:

1: `harden-inventory`:
```bash
localhost      ansible_connection=local ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python2

[servers]
192.168.56.102 ansible_ssh_user=vagrant
```

2: `harden-playbook.yml`:
```bash
- name: Harden all servers
  hosts: servers
  roles:
    - { role: CivicActions.simple-harden, become: true }
```

Then run the harden process:
```bash
ansible-playbook -i harden-inventory harden-playbook.yml
```

The results can be seen by logging into the dashboard again and re-running `govready scan`:

- This profile identifies 23 high severity selected controls. OpenSCAP says 18 passing, 3 failing, and 2 notchecked.
- This profile identifies 96 medium severity selected controls. OpenSCAP says 62 passing, 32 failing, and 2 notchecked.
- This profile identifies 60 low severity selected controls. OpenSCAP says 40 passing, 15 failing, and 5 notchecked.

## Next steps:

- Refactor, probably to Python
- Accept a (yaml) configuration file to define the dashboard and a set of servers
